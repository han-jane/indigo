<p>I am a PhD student in Haxby Lab at Dartmouth College, advised by Professor James V. Haxby. My current research interest is how we could understand and improve the learning process by using fMRI data and applying hyperalignment method.</p>

<p>I earned my B.A. in Psychology and English Literature and M.E. in Biomedical Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University . At Sungkyunkwan University, I investigated how the brain representation of visual perception is affected by top-down cognition, specifically interpretation of the scene, advised by Professor Won Mok Shim.</p>
